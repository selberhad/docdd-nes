# Meta-Document: How to Write an Effective SPEC.md

_Guide to writing specifications in the Doc-Driven Development paradigm._

---

## When to Use This

**Modes**: Both Discovery and Execution
**Discovery Mode**: `toys/toyN_name/.docdd/SPEC.md` — defines behavioral contract for isolated toy experiment
**Execution Mode**: `.docdd/feat/<feature_name>/SPEC.md` — defines behavioral contract for production feature
**Sequence**: Write after KICKOFF (execution mode) or directly after toy directory creation (discovery mode)

---

## Purpose

A **SPEC.md is a contract spike**: it defines what the system must accept, produce, and guarantee.  
It exists to make implementation falsifiable — to ensure tests and validation have clear ground truth.

---

## What a SPEC.md Is / Is Not

### ❌ Not
- Implementation details (classes, functions, algorithms)
- Internal design notes (unless exposed in the contract)
- Tutorials, manuals, or user guides
- Vague aspirations ("the system should work well")

### ✅ Is
- Precise input/output formats
- Defined state transitions or invariants
- Operation semantics (commands, APIs, behaviors)
- Error and validation rules
- Concrete test scenarios and acceptance criteria

## Core Structure

### 1. Header

**Discovery Mode**:
```markdown
# Toy Model N: [System Name] Specification
One-line purpose statement
```

**Execution Mode**:
```markdown
# [Feature Name] Specification
One-line purpose statement
```

### 2. Overview
- **What it does:** core purpose in 2–3 sentences
- **Key principles:** 3–5 bullets on design philosophy
- **Scope:** Discovery mode — isolates 1–2 complexity axes; Execution mode — production feature scope
- **Integration context:** Discovery — note inputs/outputs to other toys; Execution — note integration points in existing codebase

### 3. Data Model
Define external data formats with **realistic examples**:
- All required fields shown
- Nested structures expanded
- Field purposes explained
- JSON schemas when clarity demands

### 4. Core Operations
Document commands or APIs with a consistent pattern:
- **Syntax** (formal usage)
- **Parameters** (required/optional, ranges, defaults)
- **Examples** (simple + complex)
- **Behavior** (state changes, outputs, side effects)
- **Validation** (rules, errors, edge cases)

### 5. Test Scenarios
3 categories:
1. **Simple** — minimal case
2. **Complex** — realistic usage
3. **Error** — invalid inputs, edge handling  
Optionally, **Integration** — only if toy touches another system.

### 6. Success Criteria
Checkboxes phrased as falsifiable conditions, e.g.:
- [ ] Operation X preserves invariant Y
- [ ] Error messages are structured JSON
- [ ] Round-trip import/export retains labels

## Quality Heuristics

High-quality SPECs are:
- **Precise** — eliminate ambiguity
- **Minimal** — Discovery mode: isolate 1–2 complexity axes; Execution mode: single focused feature
- **Falsifiable** — every statement testable
- **Contextual** — note integration points when they matter
- **Mode-appropriate** — Discovery specs justify toy isolation; Execution specs integrate with production

Low-quality SPECs are:
- Vague ("system processes data")
- Over-prescriptive (dictating implementation)
- Bloated with internal details
- Missing testable criteria

---

## Conclusion

A SPEC.md is not a design novel.  
It is a **minimal, precise contract** that locks in what must hold true, so tests and implementations can be judged unambiguously. If multiple axes of complexity emerge, split them into separate toy models.
