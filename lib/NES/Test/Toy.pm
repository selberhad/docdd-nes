NES::Test::Toy - Boilerplate reducer for toy ROM testing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Old way (7 lines)
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Test::More;
    use FindBin qw($Bin);
    use lib "$Bin/../../../lib";
    use NES::Test;
    load_rom "$Bin/../scroll.nes";

    # New way (1 line)
    use NES::Test::Toy 'scroll';

    # Then write tests as normal
    after_nmi 1 => sub {
        assert_ram 0x10 => 0x01;
    };

    done_testing();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

NES::Test::Toy reduces boilerplate in toy ROM test files by:

- Auto-importing strict, warnings, Test::More, and NES::Test
- Auto-loading ROM file from parent directory
- Setting up correct lib path

This module exists purely to save tokens and make test files more concise.

=head1 USAGE

    use NES::Test::Toy 'rom_name';

Where 'rom_name' is the ROM filename (without .nes extension) in the toy's directory.

For test file at:
    toys/toy5_scrolling/t/01-test.t

ROM file expected at:
    toys/toy5_scrolling/scroll.nes

Usage:
    use NES::Test::Toy 'scroll';

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

The module uses import() magic to:

1. Enable strict/warnings in caller's package
2. Import Test::More and NES::Test
3. Calculate ROM path from caller's file location
4. Schedule load_rom() to run via END block

The END block ensures ROM loads after all test code is compiled.

=head1 TOKEN SAVINGS

Per test file:
- Before: 7 lines of boilerplate
- After: 1 line
- Savings: 6 lines Ã— ~15 test files = 90 lines total
