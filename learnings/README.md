# NES Development Learnings

This directory contains extracted technical knowledge from NESdev Wiki pages, organized into actionable implementation patterns.

---

## Documentation Practices

### Learning Documents
Located at root of `learnings/` directory. Each document:
- **Focuses on practical patterns** extracted from cached wiki pages
- **Includes code snippets** with cycle counts and timing constraints
- **Documents gotchas and pitfalls** to avoid
- **Ends with Attribution section** linking to source NESdev wiki pages

### Meta-Learnings (`.ddd/` subdirectory)
Located in `learnings/.ddd/`. These document **our learning process**:
- **INITIAL.md** - Original questions we needed to answer
- **PHASE_2.md** - Progress assessment after Priority 1-2 (core techniques)
- **PHASE_3.md** - Progress assessment after Priority 2.5-3 (toolchain + optimization)
- **PHASE_N.md** - Future phase assessments after each priority group

**Practice**: After completing each priority group in STUDY_PLAN.md, create a PHASE_N.md documenting:
- What we studied
- Key insights gained
- Questions raised
- Decisions made/pending
- Study progress summary
- Recommended next steps

### Attribution
Every learning document includes attribution footer added via `tools/add-attribution.pl`:

```markdown

## How to Use These Docs

### During Study Phase (Now)
1. **Systematic wiki reading** per STUDY_PLAN.md priorities
2. **Extract to learning docs** (practical patterns, code, constraints)
3. **Record meta-learnings** in `.ddd/PHASE_N.md` after each priority group
4. **Add attribution** via `tools/add-attribution.pl`

### During Discovery Mode (Test ROMs)
1. **Before building test ROM**: Read relevant learning doc to understand constraints
2. **Define questions**: What assumptions are we testing? (LEARNINGS.md style from DDD.md)
3. **Build test ROM**: Validate techniques from learning docs
4. **Document findings**: Update learning doc with actual measurements, edge cases

### During Execution Mode (Building Game)
1. **Reference learning docs**: Use code patterns as templates
2. **Check cycle budgets**: Ensure vblank budget isn't exceeded
3. **Apply gotcha workarounds**: Avoid documented pitfalls
4. **Update docs**: When discovering new patterns or edge cases

## Key Constraints (Always Remember)

### Timing
- **VBlank budget**: 2273 CPU cycles (NTSC), 2660 cycles (PAL)
- **OAM DMA**: 513-514 cycles (must happen in vblank)
- **Frame rate**: 60.0988 FPS (NTSC), 50.007 FPS (PAL)
- **PAL timing**: 20% slower CPU - detect video standard and compensate

### Graphics
- **Sprite limit**: 8 sprites per scanline (hardware limit, cannot exceed)
- **Sprite count**: 64 total sprites in OAM
- **Pattern tables**: 256 tiles each (left $0000-$0FFF, right $1000-$1FFF)
- **Palette memory**: 32 bytes, 4 BG + 4 sprite palettes, 4 colors each

### Memory
- **RAM**: 2KB total ($0000-$07FF)
- **Zero page**: 256 bytes ($0000-$00FF) - fast addressing, indirect addressing only
- **Stack**: 256 bytes ($0100-$01FF) - reserve 96+ bytes free space
- **OAM buffer**: 256 bytes ($0200-$02FF by convention)

### Input
- **Controller strobe**: Latch once, read 8 bits sequentially (don't re-strobe mid-read)
- **DPCM conflict**: DMC playback can glitch controller reads (disable $4017 or read multiple times)
- **Button order**: A, B, Select, Start, Up, Down, Left, Right

## Document Maintenance

### When to Update Learning Docs
- After building test ROMs (add actual cycle counts, discovered edge cases)
- When hitting hardware limitations (document workarounds)
- When finding new techniques on forums/Discord (extract to appropriate doc)
- When discovering errors in cached wiki pages (note corrections)

### When to Create Phase Docs
- After completing each priority group in STUDY_PLAN.md
- Document: what studied, insights gained, questions raised, decisions made
- Location: `learnings/.ddd/PHASE_N.md`

### Organization Principle
- **Architecture docs** â†’ What the hardware does (CPU, PPU, APU, memory)
- **Technique docs** â†’ How to use the hardware (patterns, code, budgets)
- **Tool docs** â†’ Development workflow (assemblers, emulators, graphics)
- **Meta docs** â†’ Our learning process (`.ddd/` subdirectory)

## Future: mdbook Compilation

These learnings will eventually be compiled into an **mdbook** - a cleaned up, streamlined condensation of the NESdev wiki:
- **Audience**: LLM agents (but human-friendly via clear, concise language)
- **Attribution**: External wiki links already in place
- **Organization**: Matches current document structure
- **Value**: Agent-friendly NES reference, community-contributed knowledge

---

**Remember**: NES development is constraint-driven. The docs capture the constraints; test ROMs validate them; game code works within them. Document what you learn or lose it. ðŸŽ®
